# JNotepad++
> A fully localized Notepad clone, with additional editing tools.

JNotepad++ is essentially a Notepad clone which I made during the elective course called [Fundamentals of Java](http://java.zemris.fer.hr/home/) in my 4th semester of studying at [FER](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en).
It has basic features such as loading, saving and opening files(in multiple tabs). Also has additional features such as sorting selected text, filtering duplicate lines, and printing statistical data about the file, upon request. The project was a great opportunity to learn and implement various design patterns.
I also implemented full internationalization support, where languages can be switched on the fly.
